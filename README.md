## Ethics Questions

### Question 1

> Give two possible chatroom moderation features and the reasons that you should implement each one

<!-- Put your answer to question 1 here -->
One feature would be the ability to delete messages in case a user has sent anything inappropriate. The other feature would be the ability ban a user from a room if they frequently violate the rules.
